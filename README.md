## Introduction

This is a traffic flow visualization app for VoltDB based on Vizceral from Netflix.

See https://github.com/Netflix/vizceral-example for the original example.

## Usage
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build-full`
- Now run `npm run full` to start the server

Note that currently I assume there is a cluster of 3 machines running on localhost.
